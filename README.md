# 8-bit-Two-Function-Calculator

Implemented an 8-bit, two-function calculator with Verilog on the DE10-Lite using Intel Quartus Prime. This calculator performs addition and subtraction on signed numbers.

# Features

I/O: Input numbers using a 4x4 pushbutton keypad and output is displayed on a 7-segment display.
